# REUSEABLE WIDGET IN FLUTTER ðŸ‘‹ 

## AUTHOR ðŸ¤µ: COLLINS OLOKPEDJE

This repository demonstrates the concept of a reusable widget in Flutter using the `ReuseFormWidget` as an example. A reusable widget is a custom widget designed to encapsulate certain functionalities or UI components, allowing them to be easily reused across multiple parts of an application. This concept promotes code organization, modularity, and maintainability.

### ReuseFormWidget

The `ReuseFormWidget` is a custom form widget that encapsulates the functionality of a `TextFormField` in Flutter while providing customization options for its appearance. Let's briefly go through its properties and how it can be utilized.

#### Properties

1. `bordercurve` (double?): This property represents the border curve of the `TextFormField`. It allows you to customize the border's circular radius.

2. `controls` (TextEditingController?): This property is used to control the text entered in the `TextFormField`. It enables you to set and retrieve the text programmatically.

3. `prefixIconData` (IconData?): This property represents the icon data for the prefix icon of the `TextFormField`. It allows you to specify an icon that will be displayed before the input field.

4. `suffixIconData` (IconData?): This property represents the icon data for the suffix icon of the `TextFormField`. It allows you to specify an icon that will be displayed after the input field.

5. `nameofinputfield` (String): This property is required and represents the label or hint text for the input field. It will be displayed above the input field.

6. `prefixIconColour` (MaterialColor?): This property represents the color of the prefix icon. It allows you to customize the color of the prefix icon.

7. `suffixIconColour` (MaterialColor?): This property represents the color of the suffix icon. It allows you to customize the color of the suffix icon.

#### Usage

The `ReuseFormWidget` can be used to create customizable input fields in your Flutter application. To use it, follow these steps:

1. Import the `reusable.dart` file into your Dart file where you want to use the widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_app/reusable.dart';
```

2. Create instances of the `ReuseFormWidget` with the desired customization options:

```dart
ReuseFormWidget(
  nameofinputfield: 'Username',
  bordercurve: 100,
  prefixIconColour: Colors.cyan,
  suffixIconColour: Colors.red,
  prefixIconData: Icons.person,
  suffixIconData: Icons.warning,
)
```

3. Add the `ReuseFormWidget` instances to your UI to display the custom input fields.

### Example - main.dart

In the provided `main.dart` file, we demonstrate how to use the `ReuseFormWidget` to create a login screen with two input fields (username and password). The `ReuseFormWidget` is used to replace the previously commented-out `TextFormField` widgets, resulting in cleaner and more readable code.

By adopting this reusable widget approach, you can create consistent UI elements, save development time, and easily update the appearance of multiple input fields in your application.

Feel free to explore the code and customize the `ReuseFormWidget` to suit your specific application requirements.

### Importance of Reusable Widgets

- Code Organization and Maintainability: Reusable widgets allow you to encapsulate specific functionalities or UI components in a single place. This promotes code organization and makes it easier to maintain and update your app as it grows.

- Modularity: By creating reusable widgets, you break down your UI into smaller, manageable pieces. This modularity makes it easier to understand, modify, and extend your application without affecting other parts of the codebase.

- Consistency in UI: Reusing the same widget across the app ensures a consistent look and feel. Any changes made to the reusable widget automatically propagate throughout the app, leading to a uniform user experience.

- Saves Development Time: Once you've developed a reusable widget, you can utilize it in multiple parts of your application. This saves development time as you don't need to write the same UI components repeatedly.

- Easier Collaboration: Reusable widgets enhance collaboration among team members. Developers can share and reuse widgets, reducing duplication of work and improving team productivity.

- Simplifies Debugging: If a bug is found in a reusable widget, fixing it at the source automatically resolves the issue in all instances where the widget is used. This simplifies the debugging process and ensures consistency across the app.

- Adaptability to Changes: When requirements change, you can update a reusable widget in one place, and all instances of that widget will reflect the changes. This adaptability helps keep your app in sync with evolving needs.

- Testing and Quality Assurance: Having reusable widgets promotes better unit testing practices. You can test each widget in isolation, ensuring that it functions correctly before using it in various parts of the app.


### Getting Started

To run the example provided in `main.dart`, ensure you have Flutter installed and set up your development environment.
-Add main.dartand reusable.dart toyour lib folder.

Then, simply execute the following command:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch the app on an available emulator or connected device.
